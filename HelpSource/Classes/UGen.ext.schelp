INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: equi
Process the receiver through a 5 band parametric EQ. The EQ UGens used are from the link::Classes/BEQSuite::, and consist of a link::Classes/BLowShelf::, three link::Classes/BPeakEQ::s, and a link::Classes/BHishelf::. They can be controlled by an link::Classes/EQui::, or directly using the following control names: Possible parameters are 'hiPassFreq', 'hiPassGain', 'hiPassRq', 'hiPassBypass', 'loShelfFreq', 'loShelfGain', 'loShelfRs', 'loShelfBypass', 'loPeakFreq', 'loPeakGain', 'loPeakRq', 'loPeakBypass', 'midPeakFreq', 'midPeakGain', 'midPeakRq', 'midPeakBypass', 'hiPeakFreq', 'hiPeakGain', 'hiPeakRq', 'hiPeakBypass', 'hiShelfFreq', 'hiShelfGain', 'hiShelfRs', 'hiShelfBypass', 'loPassFreq', 'loPassGain', 'loPassRq', 'loPassBypass', and 'lagEQ' (a lag time for all parameter changes). These names should be preceded by prefix (see below) if one was supplied.

ARGUMENT::params
An optional instance of link::Classes/EQuiParams:: containing initial parameter values.

ARGUMENT:: prefix
An optional link::Classes/String:: to use as a prefix to Control names. This is only necessary to distinguish when using multiple EQuis with the same synth.

ARGUMENT:: lag
A lag time used when changing parameter values.

returns:: The output of the chained EQ UGens with the receiver as input.
